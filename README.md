# 2024 EY Open Science Data Challenge Results 🥇🏆

This repository contains the results and code from our participation in the 2024 EY Open Science Data Challenge. The focus of this year's challenge was on leveraging satellite images, algorithms, and artificial intelligence to tackle coastal resilience 🏝️🌊. We are thrilled to share our award-winning solution with the community 🎉.

## Description

In this challenge, our team developed a sophisticated approach to enhance coastal resilience using satellite imagery and AI techniques. Our solution involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of advanced algorithms to predict and mitigate the impacts of coastal hazards.

The repository includes:

- **Data**: Raw and processed data used in our analysis.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Results**: Outputs and visualizations from our analysis.

Our goal is to contribute to the open science community by sharing our methodology, insights, and results. We hope that our work can inspire and assist others working on similar challenges.

## Contents

- [Data](data): Contains the raw and processed datasets used in our project.
- [Scripts](scripts): Includes all the Python scripts for data handling, model building, and evaluation.
- [Results](results): Stores the results of our analysis, including charts, graphs, and model outputs.

## Installation

To replicate our analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/competition-results.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the directory**:

    ```bash
    cd competition-results
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the analysis**:

    ```bash
    python scripts/analyze.py
    ```

2. **View the results**:

    The results will be saved in the `results` directory and include various visualizations and model performance metrics.
